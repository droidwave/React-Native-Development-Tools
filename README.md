# React Native Development Tools


React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components. With React Native, you don’t build a “mobile web app”, an “HTML5 app”, or a “hybrid app”. You build a real mobile app that’s indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C or Java. React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React.

In my opinion, is Visual Studio Code  is the best tool for React Native mobile app development? This is a lightweight super powerful free and open source code editor. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

# Visual Studio Code
